# It's OK to be a Pragmatic Developer
# It's OK to be a Laggard

As each year passes, my accumulated guilt backlog of libraries, frameworks, and technologies I'm NOT using is increasing dramatically.

As a former colleague of mine would often boisterously proclaim, "I JUST NEED TO GET DATA OUT OF THE DATABASE AND INTO A GRID". The funny thing is, that's what most of us are doing. We are not working on ?. We are moving data around! And we need to get our jobs done so we can at least pretend to have a life outside of work.

I've worked with laggards like this, and I've also worked with the bleeding edge developers. Those guys who were using Angular in production when it was at version 0.0.1. And not just that, but half way through development, the decided to re-write the app with React. Oh, and then Angular 1.5 was released. You get the picture.

The funny thing is, is that in my experience, it's the developers who wanted to put the customer first and "just get the job done" who had the highest customer satisfaction scores. They didn't care that they weren't using Angular 2 with React Components on Docker. They used the proven technology of the day to write clean code, that was easy to maintain, and relatively free of bugs. That's it.

This is my pragmatic developer.

Now, this isn't to say that we shouldn't broaden our horizons by continually learning about the latest and greatest. But when tinkering gets in the way of productivity, there will be problems.

Now if everyone were a pragmatic developer, would we be in the world we are today? Hells no! We need innovators, we need individuals who will pick up the mantle and wade through the murky waters to find us the next ?

So to you, my pragmatic developer, I say this: Give yourself a pass. Don't stress out about what you are missing. Get your job done and if whatever bright and shiny new toy that "everyone" is playing with today is successful, you'll know about it. And by the time you get to it, it'll actually be documented. Mostly.

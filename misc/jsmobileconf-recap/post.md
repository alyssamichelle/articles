# The Future of JavaScript is Bright at jsMobileConf

Last week in Boston, Progress hosted [jsMobileConf](https://jsmobileconf.com/), an event for developers looking into and beyond the traditional JavaScript ecosystem.

Over 200 attendees packed the Aloft hotel in downtown Boston for a myriad of talks spanning virtually every technology that is impacted by JavaScript. What started as a mobile-only conference (hence the name!), jsMobileConf was molded by its speakers to become a host for cutting-edge JavaScript talks. From blockchain to VR to Machine Learning to AI to mobile apps to IoT, we covered a broad array of exciting new opportunities.

> We learned quickly that JavaScript is uniquely positioned as *the* gateway to a variety of new technologies.

## {N} Developer Day --> jsMobileConf

In previous years, what is today called jsMobileConf was known as NativeScript Developer Day (an event laser-focused on NativeScript developers). After a 2016 event in Boston and a 2017 event in New York City, it became clear that we had a lot more to offer the JavaScript community. And we are pleased to say it was a smashing success!

The quality of the speaker lineup was top-notch, with an opening keynote by Ethan Marcotte (who coined the term "responsive design"):

Other notable (and popular) sessions included Simon MacDonald's FaaS and the Serverless, tackling imposter syndrome with Diana Rodriguez, and Chris Fritz's inspiring talk on...believe it or not...writing great docs!

While Microsoft's own Burke Holland gave a great talk on VS Code and Live Share, he also got to enjoy Macy Kuang's VR game demo:

Thanks to everyone who made jsMobileConf such a success, from the organizers to the speakers to the attendees.

I think my colleague Brian Rinaldi summed up jsMobileConf best:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best part of running conferences is the opportunity to meet amazing people - both speakers and attendees. This was true of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jsMobileConf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#jsMobileConf</a> even moreso! Thanks all for making it awesome. 🙏</p>&mdash; Brian Rinaldi (@remotesynth) <a href="https://twitter.com/remotesynth/status/1055953623719600128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2018</a></blockquote>

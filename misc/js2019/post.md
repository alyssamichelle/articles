# "JavaScript-Native" Mobile Development

Time certainly flies when you realize it's been almost four years since the first versions of the most popular "JavaScript-native" frameworks were first released! Born back in 2015, React Native and NativeScript are rapidly maturing and showing increased adoption when measured against competing hybrid frameworks like Cordova/Ionic. While the popularity of these frameworks is growing, some high-profile companies like AirBnb have decided to scale back their usage of React Native. Where does this put JavaScript-native on the map today and where is it headed in 2019?

> (this could be in a sidebar?) **What is a JavaScript-native framework?** Hybrid app development frameworks like PhoneGap/Cordova/Ionic let you use your web skills (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and create natively-installable apps. However, the app runs in a WebView, which presents performance and UI limitations. JavaScript-native frameworks like NativeScript and React Native use JavaScript (and CSS) to power (and style) truly native UI on the device, without any WebViews, giving you the API reach and performance you demand.

## JavaScript-Native Today

For the past two years, we've predicted a strong and steady rise in the adoption of React Native and NativeScript, and we haven't been disappointed.

Boosted by the rise of React over the past few years, React Native is THE way to develop native mobile apps with the React library. 73K GitHub stars and 45K questions on Stack Overflow make it clear how popular React Native has become. 

Like React Native, NativeScript lets you use your web skills to create truly native mobile apps for iOS and Android. NativeScript though provides official support for the Angular and Vue.js frameworks, along with plugin-free access to 100% of native device APIs. Building native iOS and Android apps from a single shared JavaScript codebase? Not bad!

By the numbers, the adoption of React Native and NativeScript is self-evident. But that doesn't mean there isn't room for another option. Let's all welcome Flutter! A product of Google, Flutter also lets you build native apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase. However, Flutter requires you to use the Dart language - which can be transpiled to JavaScript (similar to TypeScript), but has seen mixed acceptance in the community.

## JavaScript-Native in 2019

Rising tides lift all boats, and with React Native, NativeScript, and Flutter as tools, mobile app development has become more accessible to web developers than ever before. But how are these frameworks going to build on an already successful past?

Developing with any of the JavaScript-native options today provide table stakes functionality in terms of native iOS and Android development with some amount of shared code between the two mobile platforms. And while keeping up with the latest releases and APIs from Apple and Google will always be a priority, React Native has publicly stated their concerns with improving stability; NativeScript with focusing on developer productivity; and Flutter with targeting ease of adoption and core fundamentals.

With these frameworks almost effectively feature-complete, where do we see them headed in 2019?

### To the Web!

Wait a minute, didn't we just come from the web? Yes, but hear me out. Developing omni-channel mobile experiences is becoming a more and more critical component of what it means to create an "app" today. Responsive desktop + mobile web, native iOS, native Android - that's three distinct platforms to share a *single* experience.

This is where initiatives like React Native Web, NativeScript Schematics, and Flutter's Hummingbird come into play. With the ability to create responsive web experiences *along with* native iOS and Android apps, these frameworks are leading the way to advanced developer productivity and time-saving capabilities. We see this area booming in 2019.

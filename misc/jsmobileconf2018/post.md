# {N} Blog: Meet the NativeScript Experts at jsMobileConf

It's almost fall - time to think about back-to-school activities, what you're going to dress up as for Halloween ðŸŽƒ, and of course the fall tech conference season!

Over the past couple of years we've met many of you at our previous *NativeScript Developer Day* events in Boston and New York. This year we are doing something a little (ok A LOT) different. Building on our previous NativeScript-focused events, we are putting on an even bigger show that encompasses even more of the JavaScript ecosystem.

We are happy to be bringing you [jsMobileConf](https://jsmobileconf.com/) - a two-day, two-track event focused on all things JavaScript (*including* NativeScript!).

> jsMobileConf will be held on October 25th and 26th in Boston, MA. Skip the details and check out [jsMobileConf.com](https://jsmobileconf.com/) for speakers, sessions, and early bird pricing.

Come and meet some of the very best speakers from the broader NativeScript community. You'll find folks from the NativeScript Developer Relations team, members of the engineering team behind NativeScript, and a variety of community experts ([view the full speaker list](https://jsmobileconf.com/#lgx-speakers)).

## You Can Do A Lot with JavaScript

**Why jsMobileConf?** The fact of the matter is there is very little you *can't* do with JavaScript these days. We've evolved quite a bit from the embedded `<script>` tag days with some jQuery animations sprinkled in (not that there is anything wrong with that!).

**Today JavaScript means more.** It means more to developers and reaches more technologies than ever before. So it's time to bring together some of the experts in a variety of cutting-edge fields to talk about how *you* can leverage **JavaScript** to hack on:

- Native Mobile Apps and PWAs
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Blockchain
- Serverless
- AR and VR
- Artificial Intelligence

## Who is Speaking?

Ah, great question! We've already lined up some amazing speakers for you from Microsoft, Adobe, Progress, a variety of Google Developer Experts, and more.

Here is but a sample of the sessions that may interest you most:

# Kendo UI (Telerik Blog): Meet the Kendo UI and PWA Experts at jsMobileConf

Even though our summer vacations are winding down, it's important to look at the bright side: the kids are headed back to school! ðŸŽ‰

But more importantly, it's almost the fall tech conference season! If you've been following Progress and Telerik closely over the years, you know we only go big on conference season. [DevReach](https://devreach.com/) is a massively popular event we host in Sofia, Bulgaria. [ProgressNEXT](https://www.progress.com/next) is our flagship customer conference. We've also hosted *NativeScript Developer Day* events in Boston and New York the past two years.

While we are still hosting DevReach and ProgressNEXT, we are doing something a little different on the JavaScript mobility front this year. Building on the JavaScript theme, we are putting on an even bigger show that encompasses even more of the JavaScript ecosystem.

We are happy to be bringing you [jsMobileConf](https://jsmobileconf.com/) - a two-day, two-track event focused on all things JavaScript (*including* Kendo UI and PWAs!).

# Progress Blog: Meet the JavaScript Experts at jsMobileConf

Progress has been at the forefront of cutting edge JavaScript tech for years now. When you think of the web you think [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui). When you think of native mobility you think [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/). When you think serverless backend you think [Progress Kinvey](https://www.progress.com/kinvey).

This is why Progress is pleased to be hosting a new event this fall in Boston, MA. [jsMobileConf](https://jsmobileconf.com/) is a two-day, two-track, event focused on all things JavaScript (*including* Kendo UI, NativeScript, and Kinvey!).

But jsMobileConf is far more than Progress. With jsMobileConf we are putting on a show that encompasses *more* of the JavaScript ecosystem:

- Serverless
- Blockchain
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Native mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- AR and VR
- Artificial Intelligence

> jsMobileConf will be held on October 25th and 26th in Boston, MA. Skip the details and check out [jsMobileConf.com](https://jsmobileconf.com/) for speakers, sessions, and early bird pricing.

Come and meet some of the leading voices in the JavaScript community - including the best from the Progress Developer Relations team and our favorite community experts.

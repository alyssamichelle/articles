# Creating Your First Native Mobile App with Visual Studio

Visual Studio is arguably the most adored IDE of all time. For years .NET developers relied on a myriad of robust features and integrations in Visual Studio to make them more productive creating desktop and web applications. Then came mobile.

While a handful of developers leveraged Visual Studio to create Windows Phone 7/8 apps, the vast majority of mobility development was focused on iOS and Android. .NET developers were summarily left out in the cold. That is until Xamarin and Cordova came about.

Cordova presented the opportunity for web developers from all corners the ability to create hybrid mobile apps for virtually every platform. And Telerik Platform was one of the first mobile app development platforms to embrace the hybrid model (and now native). But hybrid apps tend to have their own issues with performance that truly native apps don't suffer from.

With Xamarin, .NET developers can leverage their existing knowledge of C# to build cross-compiled native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows. Combining the cross-platform capabilities of Xamarin.Forms with [Telerik UI for Xamarin](http://www.telerik.com/xamarin-ui), C# developers are now empowered to build native apps while sharing a fair amount of code. While Xamarin is a big win for C# developers, Visual Studio has always been about more than just C#.

## NativeScript

If you enjoy what TypeScript has to offer, are doing client-side development with Angular, or just like the power and flexibility of vanilla JavaScript, but also want to keep leveraging your favorite IDE, NativeScript may be just the thing for you.

> You may want to take a moment to read [NativeScript for the .NET Developer](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/nativescript-for-the-net-developer/) for more background.

NativeScript is an open source framework (with enterprise support) that allows you to build truly native, cross-platform, mobile apps using the skills you know and love:

- **XAML-like XML** for your UI markup
- **CSS** for styling your UI
- and **JavaScript/TypeScript** for your app logic

NativeScript also allows for nearly 100% code sharing across platforms as well, dramatically decreasing development time and getting you to market faster than ever before.

Add Telerik AppBuilder (part of Telerik Platform) to the mix, and you can also build your apps for iOS without owning a Mac and dealing with Xcode.

So let's build an app!

## Your First Native Mobile App

Together in this series we are going to cover literally every part of building a fully functional cross-platform app using a combination of Visual Studio, NativeScript, TypeScript, C#, and SQL Server. The app we are going to build is...and will feature the following capabilities:

- Tab-based navigation
- Remote data binding
- MVVM
- CSS/themes
- Fonts
- Images?

And just so we know what the end result will look like, here is a quick example of our soon-to-be-created app on iOS:

- app we going to build kittens and bill murray (or just bm?), complete w/ backend
- part 1 - build app structure
- part 2 - backend, fonts, icons
- part 3 - ui for n (chart), core theme, theme builder
- part 3 - debug, companion app, livesync, build/deploy on device, appmanager(?)

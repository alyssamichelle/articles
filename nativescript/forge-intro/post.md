# Introducing NativeScript Forge

As the popularity of NativeScript has grown, so have we seen a wide range of developers embrace it as their choice for cross-platform mobile app development. And with such breadth of developers comes and equally expansive range of comfort with command-line tooling. Many of us have grown to embrace CLI tooling as the most efficient way to integrate our diverse tooling. Others are more used to visual tooling where we point and click our way to app utopia. Add to this mix developers on Windows who want to leverage tooling *only* available on macOS, and we find ourselves with a clear fit for a new product we call NativeScript Forge.

> You may have heard of Fusion or Sidekick - these were code names for NativeScript Forge in its private beta releases!

## What is NativeScript Forge...Exactly?

NativeScript Forge is a desktop application that simplifies some of the more tedious aspects of mobile app scaffolding, development, and building. Forge is built on Electron, giving us the best in desktop capabilities along with an ease of providing a cross-platform solution for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Forge sits on top of the NativeScript CLI, so many of the capabilities of the CLI are exposed through a gorgeous UI.

However, Forge doesn't preclude you from using the CLI! You can use Forge alongside the NativeScript CLI to use visual tooling when you want it, and command-line tooling when you need it.

Let's take a quick look at just some of the high value features of NativeScript Forge.

- Starter Kits
- Fast Cloud (and Local) Builds
- Debugging/LiveSync
- Plugin Management
- Asset Management

## Starter Kits

When building a new app, some of us like to start from scratch with a blank template. Others of us like some help with scaffolding out the basic UI and logic of our app. NativeScript Forge provides a set of easy-to-use "starter kits" for a variety of scenarios:

- Blank Template
- Side Drawer Navigation
- Tab Navigation
- Master/Detail

Not only do we provide multiple starter kits, but each starter kit is also available in one of three flavors:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Angular

## Fast Cloud (and Local) Builds

When it comes to native mobile app development, nothing can be much more annoying than configuring the myriad SDKs required to build an app for iOS and Android. Luckily for us, NativeScript Forge allows you to build an app in the cloud, with no configuration required on your end.

Yes, that means Windows developers can generate builds for iOS without needing a Mac! Plus, all of our iOS builds run on super fast Mac Pros, so unless you are running top-of-the-line Mac arrays in your home or office, there is a decent chance our cloud builds will actually be faster than your local builds!

## Debugging/LiveSync

What's the next most annoying thing about mobile app development? Debugging. Historically one of the huge trade-offs from moving from the web to native mobile was the lack of debugging tools. Not any more. With NativeScript Forge we provide a variety of capabilities to help improve your debugging experience across all platforms with:

**LiveSync** - Imagine being able to make changes to *any* part of your app, hit save, and have those changes almost instantly appear on any simulators or connected devices. That's LiveSync in a nutshell.

**Debugging** - Likewise, imagine tapping into the native debugging capabilities of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Forge helps you leverage the debuggers in those two wildly popular IDEs.

## Plugin Management

Discovering and configuring NativeScript plugins has admittedly become much easier over the years. First, with the new plugins repository, finding the right for the job is easier than ever before. (Hint, it's going to get even better soon!).

However, Forge also provides an interface for finding, installing, and updating plugins, making it even easier to manage your plugins:

## Asset Management

Finally, managing app icons and splashscreens has always been a bit of an annoyance. Forge provides an easy to use UI for viewing what your current app icons are, and very soon, will provide the capability of creating both app icons and full splashscreens (for all platforms) from one source image!

## Pricing

Would you like to know how much we will be charging for NativeScript Forge? Once the public beta phase is over, we plan to offer an extremely generous free tier which we think will satisfy the needs of the vast majority of developers. Heavy users of our cloud builds, for instance, will have to pay a small fee to generate a certain number of builds per month. More pricing information will be available in the coming weeks!

## What's Coming Next?

This is the spot where I typically say, "it's just the beginning!". And well, that's true! This is merely the public beta phase of Forge where we invite you to test out all of our features and let us know what works, what doesn't, and what else you want to see.

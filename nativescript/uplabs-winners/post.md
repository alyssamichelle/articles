# Who Won the NativeScript-Uplabs Challenge?

A couple of months ago, NativeScript and Uplabs teamed up to challenge developers and designers to put together the very best native app UIs they could, using NativeScript (of course) and the NativeScript Playground.

We viewed this as a design challenge primarily. Everyone knows you can create native UIs with NativeScript, but not everyone knows that you can build *engaging* native UIs as well.

We were very pleased to see the submissions roll in. And to be honest, many of the entries blew us away. I'll admit *I didn't even know* you could build some of these UIs so easily with just a smattering of CSS.

CODE?

As part of the challenge, we of course offered significant cash prizes for the top apps. $1,000 for the highest voted app on Uplabs.com by the community and $2,000 to be handed out by a small committee of folks here at Progress.

We are pleased to announce the winners!

## $1,000 Community Prize

Congratulations to XXX and XXX for their app: XXX.

This gorgeous app does...and uses...

You can view the completed NativeScript Playground project as well.

## $2,000 NativeScript Prize

The XXX app is great, but we dug a little deeper into the projects and designs to pick our winner. Congrats are due to XXX and XXX for the app they created: XXX.

Like XXX, it's another beautiful and engaging cross-platform UI that runs seamlessly across both iOS and Android devices. You can also find this app on the NativeScript Playground.

## More Templates for You!

These are only 2 of the 36 fantastic entries we received. As time goes on, we hope to move many of these apps over to the sample apps section on the NativeScript Marketplace. We plan on adding Angular, Vue.js, and JavaScript/TypeScript variations where missing and provide additional design patterns to make it easier than ever for you to copy-and-paste your way to an engaging app UI with NativeScript.

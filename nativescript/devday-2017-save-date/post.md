On what is sure to be a perfect fall day in the Big üçé, we invite you to come collaborate with the growing community of NativeScript developers, Progress's own Developer Relations team, and core members of the NativeScript engineering team.

*When is it happening you ask?*

**NativeScript Developer Day will take place on September 18-19, 2017.**

Both seasoned and novice mobile developers alike will find a lot to ‚ù§Ô∏è at NativeScript Developer Day. While we don't have specific details to share *quite* yet, we know there will be:

- NativeScript workshops;
- Sessions from leading community members;
- Insight from the team behind NativeScript;
- Serious networking opportunities;
- ...and maybe a surprise or two üòâ.

More information will be available soon on the [official NativeScript Developer Day website](http://developerday.nativescript.org/). Until all of the details are available though, we wanted YOU to save the date for a great chance to learn more about NativeScript in the city so nice they named it twice!

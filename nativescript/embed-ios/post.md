# Embedding NativeScript in an Existing iOS App

The concept of a [greenfield project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) is relatively unfamiliar to many of us these days. We are maintaining legacy web and mobile apps, and fresh development is sometimes left to our free time. This can make adoption of relatively new frameworks more difficult, because we simply don't have the opportunity to leverage new technology within old projects.

Take NativeScript for instance. What better way to develop a native, cross-platform, mobile app than to use the web skills you have been honing for years? Well, many of us are dealing with traditional (Objective-C, Swift, Java) apps and don't have the option of using NativeScript. Until now that is:

We've recently updated the NativeScript docs and introduced a new article with **step-by-step instructions embedding NativeScript in an iOS app!**

> If you're curious about embedding NativeScript in an Android app, [take a look at this article](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/06/legacy-android-java-nativescript-angular/) by Nic Raboy.

Please note that this integration is still very new and in an experimental state. Feel free to report any issues you find in the [appropriate Github repository](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-ios-embedded/issues).

Good luck and happy NativeScript-in-iOS-ing!

# Announcing the Release of the NativeScript-Vue Introduction Video Course

After over a year of planning and waiting for a super stable version, it’s my pleasure to announce that together with the version 2.0 release of [NativeScript-Vue](https://nativescript-vue.org/), we at NativeScripting.com have released a beginner level video course called [NativeScript-Vue Introduction](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-vue-introduction/).

Whether you’re like me, a NativeScript developer who’s always wanted to try Vue, or you’re a Vue developer who wants to create native iOS and Android apps using your favorite UI framework, this course will get you started.

The course currently consists of seven chapters and 48 video lessons of content to get you started with NativeScript-Vue. It starts from scratch and builds your knowledge of working with UI in NativeScript while integrating Vue concepts. It describes the performance benefits of using certain native UI elements and navigation techniques over others. And it discusses how using Vue in a native mobile application is very similar to using it on the web, along with some differences.

Even though this video course is for beginners it doesn’t skip any foundational knowledge about how components derive from the main Vue instance and how Global components lead to Single File Components. There is also an extensive chapter on styling and animation as well as super useful info on tooling.

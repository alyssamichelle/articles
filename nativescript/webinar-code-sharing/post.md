NativeScript's collaboration with the Angular team at Google is in full swing!

The ability to [share code between your Angular web app and native mobile apps](https://blog.angular.io/apps-that-work-natively-on-the-web-and-mobile-9b26852495e7) has never been easier (or more important). Who has the time to invest resources into separate apps for web, native iOS, and native Android? By using Angular with NativeScript, you can re-use 70-80% of your code, while providing engaging experiences across all devices.

**Join us on [Thursday, October 11th at 11AM ET](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2763645959595670529?source=blog) as we dive into the very latest in web to mobile code sharing with Angular and NativeScript!**

In this webinar we will show you how you can take an existing Angular Web project and add NativeScript to it, by converting it to a code-sharing project. Then we will go through a few steps of converting individual components and modules into a code-sharing structure. *How?*

As you'll see, it's quite simple:

1. Convert your project with the power of the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) and the [NativeScript Schematics](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-schematics)
2. Use Angular and NativeScript to build for web and native iOS + Android

# A Brief Intro to NativeScript-Vue

Welcome to a week of Vue on the NativeScript blog! This week we are bringing you loads of Vue-related content, focusing on the nativescript-vue plugin that brings the world of Vue to native mobile app development.

Coming up this week you'll find topics such as:

Today we are going to focus on nativescript-vue for the absolute beginner. Why someone might want to use Vue (versus Angular and versus vanilla JavaScript). How you get started with nativescript-vue. And where to go next.

Let's get started shall we?

## Why Vue?

The Vue.js framework was first released in 2016 by former Googler Evan You. Evan was a member of the AngularJS team, which makes a lot of sense as we start drawing the lines between these frameworks.

We all know that AngularJS became Angular 2, which is now just known as Angular. Evan's experience with AngularJS inspired him to write a new framework that could maybe considered more lightweight, or at least less complex, than Angular. This effort soon became Vue.js.

Today Vue stands as the third "most popular" JavaScript framework, behind Angular(JS) and React. Why? At 17KB the core library is tiny, but contains just enough powerful features to make it an engaging alternative to Angular. Vue contains features such as:

Sound a bit like AngularJS?

Fast forward to 2017. NativeScript is taking off with its Angular integration. But Angular is admittedly not for everyone and the vanilla JavaScript option can lead to a little too much spaghetti code for some. However, due to the extensible nature of the core NativeScript framework, it became obvious that a Vue integration was achievable. Enter Mr. Igor Ra? and nativescript-vue.

## What's this NativeScript-Vue Thing?

The beauty of open source software is that anyone who is justly inspired and skilled can toss a snowball down a mountain and see what comes of it. In Igor's case, his nativescript-vue snowball was latched onto immediately by the NativeScript Developer Relations team and some prominent community members. We all realized we had something special.

So what is nativescript-vue? Quite simply it's a plugin that enables the usage of Vue.js with NativeScript. Duh. It's not a fork of Vue or a fork of NativeScript. It builds on those frameworks' capabilities to provide you with the means to create truly native cross-platform apps with this shiny new framework everyone is raving about.

Since Vue doesn't (directly) interact with the browser's DOM (like React and Angular), code you might have thought was only meant for a browser works just fine in a NativeScript app:

## How Do I Get Started

If you're new to NativeScript, I apologize as I've gotten a bit ahead of myself. NativeScript is an open source (Apache 2 licensed) framework for building native, cross-platform mobile apps from one codebase. Think along the lines of JavaScript + CSS + XML-flavored markup with a bit of {N} magic turns this:

...into this:

If you're new to Vue, welcome! Many of us are as well. The most important concepts to grok with Vue are:

With the pleasantries out of the way, let's take a quick look at using nativescript-vue to create a quick app that will work equally well on iOS and Android.

## NativeScript Playground

There are a few different ways to really dig in with NativeScript:

- NativeScript CLI
- NativeScript Sidekick
- NativeScript Playground

They each have their advantages, but today we want the most friction-free route, which I think is the Playground. The NativeScript Playground provides a web-based environment for quickly scaffolding up sample apps. Whether you are experimenting with NativeScript or want to share a code sample with someone, the Playground is an ideally way for you to write code and run it on a physical device.

To really see the power of the NativeScript Playground, you're going to want to download a couple of free apps from the App Store or Google Play:

- iOS: Playground and Preview
- Android: Playground and Preview

Two apps? What gives? One app (Playground) let's you scan a QR code and provides ???. The other (Preview) is kind of a dummy container that your app runs inside.

Let's start with this template.

Pretty magical, no?

Once we are in the Playground, you can see we have a simple Vue app scaffolded up for us.

With those changes in place, let's see what this looks like on a device. Click the QR Code button, and scan that code with your Playground app. The app should pop open in the Preview app and voila:

Hey, you're a NativeScript AND Vue developer now!

## What's Next?

The world is your oyster, but for now, stay tuned to the NativeScript blog all week and you'll learn a lot more from some folks who are a lot smarter than I. Enjoy!

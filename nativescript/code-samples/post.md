# Open Source Code Samples in the NativeScript Marketplace

I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished copy-and-paste developer. I've certainly honed my *Google Search --> Stack Overflow --> Copy Code* routine over the years. 🤓

Ok maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration (it's not) but the reality is few of us want to re-create what's already been built. Why not <del>copy</del> <del>steal</del> borrow ideas from others? Whether it's merely for inspiration or straight up copy-and-paste coding, we all want to be more efficient developers.

This is why we've added on to the [NativeScript Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/) and created a series of *free* and *open source* [**NativeScript Code Samples**](https://market.nativescript.org/?tab=samples)!

The initial release of our code samples includes **34 unique NativeScript apps** that are:

- 🔓 Open source and immediately runnable on the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/);
- 📱 iOS and Android compatible;
- 🏗️ Built with Angular, Vue.js, and/or JavaScript/TypeScript (most are built for all three!).

The samples include apps that range from **simple building blocks**:

...to **fancier-looking** listviews and card layouts:

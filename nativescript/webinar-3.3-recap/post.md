Last week hundreds of NativeScript developers tuned in to hear about the **Evolution of NativeScript**. But what *exactly* did that entail?

- [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper) showed off the latest in NativeScript tooling: from the [Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/), to the [Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/), to [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick);
- [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) gave a primer on sharing code between an Angular web app and a native mobile app;
- [TJ VanToll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll) told us about the next release of NativeScript and gave a quick run down of squeezing more performance out of your apps;
- [Eddy Verbruggen](https://twitter.com/eddyverbruggen) gave a demo of his latest work around [Augmented Reality in NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/preview-of-augmented-reality-in-nativescript);
- [Rob Lauer](https://twitter.com/RobLauer) had the arduous duty of emceeing and gave a brief demo of the new Sidekick extension for Visual Studio.

## Best of the Questions

We love having the opportunity to answer questions live during the event. If you're curious, you can take a look at the Q&A by checking out [#AskNativeScript](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23asknativescript&src=typd) on Twitter.

We had some great questions, but this one stood out:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskNativescript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AskNativescript</a> Will SideKick support webpack?</p>&mdash; Josh Comley (@joshcomley) <a href="https://twitter.com/joshcomley/status/921026044748025856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

And yes, **[it is planned](https://github.com/NativeScript/sidekick-feedback/issues/10)**. Improving Sidekick is an ongoing effort and this feature is a perfect example of that process!

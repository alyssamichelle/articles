# Updates to NativeScript Sidekick Announced at Developer Day

Did you make it to NativeScript Developer Day in the Big 🍎 last week? If not, you missed some fantastic sessions on the NativeScript framework along with numerous NativeScript tooling announcements. Luckily for you, we will be blogging about these updates this week and next! First up today is every NativeScript superhero's favorite companion: NativeScript Sidekick.

**Let's jump right into the big updates!**

- Access to Free Apple Developer Account
- iOS Provisioning and Certification Generation
- Preview of Visual Studio Extension
- NativeScript Marketplace Integration
- Sidekick Pricing Announced
- Everything Else

## Access to Free Apple Developer Account

The bane of iOS development, Apple's $99/year developer accounts are a sure-fire way to discourage hobbyist developers. However, there is a little known process that allows you to create **free** iOS developer accounts, and Sidekick does the heavy lifting to set this up for you!

> While the free Apple developer accounts allow you to develop/sideload an iOS app, you will need to purchase a $99 account to publish an app to the App Store.

Simply use the ??? menu in Sidekick and ???????

## iOS Provisioning and Certification Generation

If having access to a free iOS developer account isn't enough, how about handling the pain of iOS device provisioning and certificate generation for you? Now in Sidekick you can request certificates and provisioning profiles be created, in a dead simple UI:

This is doubly cool for Windows developers, as this literally means you don't need a Mac for *any* part of your iOS development process! You don't need a Mac for builds (due to Sidekick's cloud builds), you don't need a Mac to generate certificates or profiles, and you don't need a Mac for app store publishing.

## Preview of Visual Studio Extension

While we realize our Visual Studio Code add-on is wildly popular, our classic Visual Studio developers were feeling left out in the cold. That's why we are pleased to announce a preview version of our NativeScript extension for Visual Studio!

Using this Visual Studio extension, you can leverage Sidekick features within your beloved IDE. Perform cloud builds, local builds, access the debugger, and LiveSync your way to a cross-platform mobile app in no time.

You can download the preview of the extension here. And please be sure to provide your feedback!

## NativeScript Marketplace Integration

At NativeScript Developer Day, we announced the creation of the NativeScript Marketplace. Is this just another plugin repository? Heck no! The marketplace is not only a source of plugin discovery, but we are also providing assurance and **verifying** plugin functionality. The days are gone of trying to compare plugins that claim to perform the same functions. Going forward our engineering teams will be placing a stamp of approval on certain plugins to help you choose the right plugin for your mission-critical app.

Look forward to a blog post next week that dives deeper into what the marketplace is today and what it will become in the near future!

## Sidekick Pricing Announced

When we first announced the public beta of Sidekick, we told you to use Sidekick as you please and pricing information will come later. Well, now is the time and I'm pleased to announce that regular use of Sidekick will remain completely free!

However, if you are a power user, you may find yourself needing access to more cloud builds than what we allot in the free tier. This is why we've created some reasonable pricing tiers for you cloud build aficionados:

We will continue to listen to you and make sure our pricing for Sidekick remains competitive and a solid value for you and/or your company.

## Everything Else

Oh my there is so much else to share!

- The Sidekick debugger has been upgraded to function properly with LiveSync enabled;
- Did you hear that NativeScript UI is now completely free? More on this later! Sidekick now exposes the *newly free* NativeScript UI controls;
- Sidekick documentation has moved to docs.nativescript.org, which also means you can contribute!

## What's Next from Sidekick

NativeScript Sidekick is a critical component of the ecosystem. Soon we will be releasing support for Webpack in cloud builds to make your apps start faster with a smaller package size. We will also be taking the "public beta" label off and releasing Sidekick 1.0 in the coming weeks.

Thanks for all of your support and, if you haven't already, download your own free copy of NativeScript Sidekick.

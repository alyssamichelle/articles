# ng-conf 2018 with Sani Yusuf

At [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) this year, our own [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) spent some time interviewing a variety of luminaries (and personalities!). Talking about everything from NativeScript, to Angular 6, to Angular Schematics, these interviews are well worth the watch.

Today we have Sebastian speaking with [Sani Yusuf](https://twitter.com/saniyusuf), Google Developer Expert, founder of [Haibrid](http://www.haibrid.com/), and co-founder of [UI School](https://twitter.com/theuischool).

# ng-conf 2018 with Shai Reznik

At [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) this year, our own [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) spent some time interviewing a variety of luminaries (and personalities!). Talking about everything from NativeScript, to Angular 6, to Angular Schematics, these interviews are well worth the watch.

Today we have Sebastian speaking with [Shai Reznik](https://twitter.com/shai_reznik), Google Developer Expert and Founder/Teacher at [HiRez.io](http://hirez.io/).

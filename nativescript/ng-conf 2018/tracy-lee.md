# ng-conf 2018 with Tracy Lee

At [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) this year, our own [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) spent some time interviewing a variety of luminaries (and personalities!). Talking about everything from NativeScript, to Angular 6, to Angular Schematics, these interviews are well worth the watch.

Today we have Sebastian speaking with [Tracy Lee](https://twitter.com/ladyleet), Google Developer Expert and Co-Founder at [This Dot Labs](https://www.thisdot.co/labs/), a framework agnostic mentoring and consulting firm for all things JavaScript.

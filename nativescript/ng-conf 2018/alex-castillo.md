# ng-conf 2018 with Alex Castillo

At [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) this year, our own [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) spent some time interviewing a variety of luminaries (and personalities!). Talking about everything from NativeScript, to Angular 6, to Angular Schematics, these interviews are well worth the watch.

Today we have Sebastian speaking with [Alex Castillo](https://twitter.com/castillo__io), Google Developer Expert and co-founder of [Neurosity](https://www.neurosity.co/).

# ng-conf 2018 with Asim Hussain

At [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) this year, our own [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) spent some time interviewing a variety of luminaries (and personalities!). Talking about everything from NativeScript, to Angular 6, to Angular Schematics, these interviews are well worth the watch.

Today we have Sebastian speaking with [Asim Hussain](https://twitter.com/jawache), Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft.

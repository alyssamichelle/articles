# ng-conf 2018 with Jeff Whelpley

At [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) this year, our own [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) spent some time interviewing a variety of luminaries (and personalities!). Talking about everything from NativeScript, to Angular 6, to Angular Schematics, these interviews are well worth the watch.

Today we have Sebastian speaking with [Jeff Whelpley](https://twitter.com/jeffwhelpley), Google Developer Expert and CTO/co-founder of both [GetHuman](https://gethuman.com/) and [Swish Money](https://swish.com/).

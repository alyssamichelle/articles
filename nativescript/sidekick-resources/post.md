# Managing Your App Resources and Settings with NativeScript Sidekick

You made it through the week of [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick)! All week we have been covering some of the most high-value features that help make your life developing cross-platform native mobile apps with NativeScript even easier. The last post in this series is going to take a look at how Sidekick helps you to manager your app assets, resources, and settings.

Hopefully you've been following along all week. If not, no worries, as you can check back in on the other features we covered here:

- Intro to Sidekick
- Starter Kits
- Cloud Builds and iOS on Windows Features
- Debugging and LiveSync
- Resource and Settings Management (today!)

Gone are the days of manually editing your `AndroidManifest.xml` and `info.plist` files. Sidekick helps you to configure some of the most annoying options and settings for both Android and iOS.

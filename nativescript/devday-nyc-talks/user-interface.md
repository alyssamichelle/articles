# NativeScript Developer Day - Sessions on UI

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

> Tip: You can find the [full YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiKWVuUOQtPYyhbjndwdXu0ajhOPOMSoc)!

Today we are focused on developing a proper UI with NativeScript (three sessions):

### [TJ VanToll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll) offers a session on NativeScript UI - Beyond the Basics

*NativeScript UI is a set of free and premium user interface components for building powerful interactions in your apps. In this session youâ€™ll learn what the components are, how they work, and some of the fun things you can do with them in your apps. Come to learn more about building charts, graphs, forms, and more ðŸ“Š*

You may [download the slides](https://github.com/remotesynth/nativescript-developer-day-2017/blob/master/presentations/NativeScript-UI.pptx) for this session as well.

### Next up, [Vasil Chimev](https://twitter.com/vchimev) and [Svetoslav Tsenov](https://twitter.com/SvetoslavTsenov) provide an Introduction to Mobile UI Test Automation

*Mobile test automation is hard, but, in many cases, functional UI testing is inevitable for a mobile application. In this session weâ€™ll learn how to easily create functional UI tests with a single code base for both Android and iOS using the nativescript-dev-appium plugin in JavaScript. In addition, weâ€™re going to shed the light on how the core team tests the NativeScript framework and details on the open source functional testing framework we develop, maintain and use for guaranteeing quality of the NativeScript.*

### Finally, [Nathan Walker](https://twitter.com/wwwalkerrun), [Nathanael Anderson](https://twitter.com/CongoCart), and [Brad Martin](https://twitter.com/BradWayneMartin) do a collaborative talk on NativeScript Plugins - A Deep Dive

*We invite you to take an exhilarating adventure into the wildly interesting and abundantly vast terrain of NativeScript plugin building. Join the nStudio team to meet 3 of the communities top plugin developers, Nathan Walker, Brad Martin and Nathanael Anderson, to dive deep into best practices when harnessing the power and versatility of rich languages like Objective C, Swift and Java inside NativeScript. Whether you are seeking to learn more about custom plugin development (service layer to specialized view components) or longing for a better understanding of how these languages can be used in NativeScript, this workshop is for you.*

# NativeScript Developer Day - Chrome DevTools in NativeScript

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

In the coming days and weeks we will be providing the recordings of each session delivered at NativeScript Developer Day NYC.

> Tip: You can find the [full YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiKWVuUOQtPYyhbjndwdXu0ajhOPOMSoc)!

Today, [Peter Kanev](https://twitter.com/PeterKanev) brings us his session on **Chrome DevTools in NativeScript**:

*Whether you are a seasoned developer or a rookie, you’ll eventually stumble upon your application acting strangely. But you are a web developer, you are used to console.logging variables until the source of the problem became evident. What if there was an easier, and more efficient way to get there? We’ll explore a buggy app, locate bugs, and debug it, thanks to Chrome DevTools.*

# NativeScript Developer Day - Opening Keynote

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

In the coming days and weeks we will be providing the recordings of each session delivered at NativeScript Developer Day NYC.

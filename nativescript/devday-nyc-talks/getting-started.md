# NativeScript Developer Day - Sessions on Getting Started

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

> Tip: You can find the [full YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiKWVuUOQtPYyhbjndwdXu0ajhOPOMSoc)!

Today we are focused on the NativeScript getting started experience (two sessions):

### [Rob Lauer](https://twitter.com/RobLauer) offers a session on Getting Started with NativeScript Part 1 - Learning the Basics

*So you want to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android, with JavaScript? You’ve certainly come to the right place. In this talk, we will cover how we got to where we are today with NativeScript, take a brief look at some competing frameworks, and show you how to build a simple NativeScript app from scratch. You’ll learn how to use the skills of a web developer (JavaScript, CSS, and a tag-based markup language) to create truly native cross-platform apps from one codebase.*

You may [download the slides](https://github.com/remotesynth/nativescript-developer-day-2017/blob/master/presentations/NativeScript-101.pptx) for this session as well.

### Then both [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) and [Rob Lauer](https://twitter.com/RobLauer) provide a session on Getting Started with NativeScript Part 2 - Building with the NativeScript CLI and Visual Tooling

*Whether you are a die-hard command-line developer or prefer the ease of point-and-click visual tooling solutions, NativeScript has your back. In this session you’ll learn how to use the most important features of the NativeScript CLI. We will also dive into some new visual tooling offerings and see how they can supplement (and sometimes replace) functionality provided by the CLI.*

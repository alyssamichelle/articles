# NativeScript Developer Day - Sessions on Angular

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

> Tip: You can find the [full YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiKWVuUOQtPYyhbjndwdXu0ajhOPOMSoc)!

Today we are focused on using Angular with NativeScript (three sessions):

### [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) provides a session on Sharing Code Between Web and Native Apps

*NativeScript has opened up a whole new world to Angular developers: the ability to share code directly between your web and native iOS/Android applications. Which is awesome! But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesn’t mean that you necessarily should.
In this talk we’ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. We’ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then we’ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips &amp; tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments.*

### [Jeff Whelpley](https://twitter.com/jeffwhelpley) offers a Deep Dive Intro to Angular

*Whether you are an experienced Angular veteran or you are a complete newbie, it helps to hear about mistakes made and lessons learned from other developers. Fortunately, Jeff has made every mistake in the book. In this talk, Jeff will go over the high level concepts involved with Angular (ex. TypeScript, DI, AoT, etc.), but will also provide his detailed opinions on important best practices that may help you avoid the same mistakes as you build some wicked awesome Angular apps.*

### And last but not least, [Nic Raboy](https://twitter.com/nraboy) takes us on a journey of Native to Hybrid and Back Again:

*There are many ways to develop mobile applications for your organization. You can use Java with the Android SDK to develop Android applications, Objective-C or Swift with Xcode for iOS applications, or you can adventure into the realm of cross-platform development using common web technologies like JavaScript, Angular, and React. Not every solution to mobile application development is considered equal. Learn why I went from native development with Java to hybrid development with Ionic Framework and back to native development with NativeScript through examples and personal stories.*

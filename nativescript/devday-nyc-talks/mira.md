# NativeScript Developer Day - Optimizing Startup Time of Angular Apps

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

In the coming days and weeks we will be providing the recordings of each session delivered at NativeScript Developer Day NYC.

Today, [Stanimira Vlaeva](https://twitter.com/StanimiraVlaeva) offers a session on **Optimizing Startup Time of NativeScript Angular Apps**:

*Performance is a dreaded part of app development. This is particularly true for mobile apps where the expectations are high. Weâ€™ll explore a few methods for improving startup time for NativeScript Angular projects. Live demo included. Topics include:*

- *Lazy Loading*
- *Webpack*
- *AoT compilation*
- *Minification and tree-shaking*
- *V8 heap snapshots*
- *Profiling startup time*

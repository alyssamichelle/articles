# NativeScript Developer Day - The Power of RxJS in NativeScript and Angular

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

In the coming days and weeks we will be providing the recordings of each session delivered at NativeScript Developer Day NYC.

> Tip: You can find the [full YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiKWVuUOQtPYyhbjndwdXu0ajhOPOMSoc)!

Today, [Tracy Lee](https://twitter.com/ladyleet) provides a session on **The Power of RxJS in NativeScript and Angular**:

*Learn the importance of RxJS, simple implementation, and how to think reactively. Why is reactive programming the way of the future? What is in store with TC39 specs and reactive programming? Demonstrations of RxJS in nativescript and Angular wrapping APIs in Observables and how to easily refactor your code to use RxJS.*

# NativeScript Developer Day - Mastering NativeScript Layouts

[NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/) took place in New York City on September 18th and 19th, 2017. Developer Day is all about providing a dedicated time and space for developers to interface with community experts (and core NativeScript engineering!) to talk all things NativeScript.

In the coming days and weeks we will be providing the recordings of each session delivered at NativeScript Developer Day NYC.

Today, [Brad Martin](https://twitter.com/BradWayneMartin) brings us his session on **Mastering NativeScript Layouts**:

*The core layouts for NativeScript are powerful and mobile UI layouts can be challenging. I’ve been doing NS layouts for a long time and have struggled to master the concepts and now you don’t have to. In this session you’ll learn some tips &amp; tricks as we recreate popular mobile apps like Facebook and Twitter using NativeScript layouts.*

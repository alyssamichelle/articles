# Announcing the NativeScript Forum Rewards Program

It is no secret that successful open source initiatives depend on the community at large to provide support for new, up-and-coming, developers. Case in point: the NativeScript Forum is becoming a one-stop-shop for your NativeScript framework questions. And while our Github issues page will always be there to report bugs, the forum is the first place we'd like people to go with their questions - simply because, while you are unique, your question may not be SMILE.

We are incredibly appreciative of our community members who regularly step up to answer questions on the forum. And to thank those of you who do put your valuable time into responding to queries, solving problems, or even finding another resource to help, we'd like to reward you.

I'm happy today to announce the NativeScript Forum Rewards Program!

## How Does it Work?

On or about the first of every month, we will offer a choice of prizes to the top ??? people who have received the most hearts for the previous month. Likewise, we will offer larger prizes every quarter (i.e. January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, October 1st) for the top ??? people who received the most hearts for that quarter.

This system relies on all of us to make sure we are sending out hearts when someone has helped us!

## What are the Prizes?

Glad you asked! The monthly prizes will be a choice of:

- $100 Amazon Gift Card
- ...

The quarterly prizes will be a choice of:

- Amazon Echo
- ...

## When Does it Start?

Today! As of today (November 1st) we will start tracking hearts and will regularly send out prizes starting on December 1st. We will maintain a sticky post with information about the program, along with a list of the previous winners.

THANK YOU to everyone who has helped make NativeScript a successful open source project and please continue to help out others on the NativeScript Forum.

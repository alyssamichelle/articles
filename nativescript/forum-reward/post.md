# Announcing NativeScript Forum Rewards

It's no secret that open source projects depend heavily on their communities to help organically grow adoption. A big part of that is support, and while there are options for paid enterprise-level support from the NativeScript team, scaling free community support is critical for nurturing a healthy ecosystem.

Our free NativeScript community support options started with Slack. And Slack has been great! We have over 4,200 developers on our various channels. But Slack conversations can get lost in the shuffle, which is why we introduced the NativeScript Forum (running on the Discourse platform) some time ago.

We are incredibly appreciative of our community members who regularly step up to answer questions on the forum. So, to thank those of you who do put your valuable time into responding to queries, solving problems, or even finding other resources to help, we'd like to reward you.

**Today I'm happy to announce NativeScript Forum Rewards!**

## How Does it Work?

On or about the first of every month, we will offer gifts to the top three individuals who have received the most "likes" (represented by a heart in forum posts) in the previous month. Likewise, we will offer premium NativeScript clothing every quarter (i.e. January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, October 1st) for the person who received the most "likes" in the previous quarter.

> To be as accurate as possible, this system relies on all of us to make sure we are handing out likes when someone has helped answer a question!

## What are the Rewards?

Glad you asked! The **monthly rewards** will be:

- 1st: $150 Gift Card
- 2nd: $100 Gift Card
- 3rd: $50 Gift Card

> Gift card choices will likely be Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Starbucks.

The **quarterly reward** will be a choice of premium NativeScript clothing. This is way better than what we hand out at conferences :). For example:

*Note: In the event that international shipping is untenable, we reserve the right to deliver an electronic gift card in lieu of physical merchandise.*

Of course, gifts will only be available for non-Progress employees. Sorry to my active forum crew of Jen, TJ, and Sebastian :(.

And yes, in the event of a tie in any given month/quarter, we will give out multiple prizes!

## Leaderboards

You'll be able to follow along (mostly) using the reports provided by Discourse:

- [Monthly Leaders](https://discourse.nativescript.org/u?period=monthly)
- [Quarterly Leaders](https://discourse.nativescript.org/u?period=quarterly)

> I say "mostly" because Discourse always shows the last month/quarter from today's date, not the last calendar month/quarter.

## When Does it Start?

Next week! As of **November 1st, 2017** we will start tracking likes and will send out gifts starting December 1st. We will also maintain a sticky forum post with information about the program (along with a list of the previous winners).

THANK YOU to everyone who has helped make NativeScript a successful open source project and please continue to help out others on the NativeScript Forum hug.

# NativeScript-Vue 2.0: Back to the Vueture

![nativescript-vue 2.0 webinar](nativescript-vue-webinar.jpg)

[NativeScript-Vue](https://nativescript-vue.org/) is turning 2.0! 🎉

The interest in using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to create truly native, cross platform, mobile apps with NativeScript is taking off 🚀. In fact, Vue.js users are the *fastest growing* segment of all NativeScript developers 👩‍🚀👨‍🚀.

What better way to celebrate 2.0 than to learn about all of what's new, updated, and fixed with the latest version!?

**Join us on [Thursday, October 4th at 11AM ET](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1758384468554226433?source=blog) as we dive into NativeScript-Vue 2.0!**

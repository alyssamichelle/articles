# Join the NativeScript Challenge on Uplabs ðŸ¥Š

[Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/) is a wildly popular community of designers and developers who contribute amazing app concepts and mockups on everything from a [Netflix redesign](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/netflix-redesign-challenge/results) to screens with (figuratively) [nothing to show](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/empty-states-challenge/results). We are happy to announce that NativeScript is partnering with Uplabs to bring designers and developers together in competition to create simple, but visually engaging, apps built with NativeScript!

Using the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/), you'll create a simple app (e.g. 1-3 pages/views) that works equally well on both iOS and Android. There is **no specific theme** so the world is your oyster with this challenge! *It's truly form over function for this contest.* ðŸ˜Ž

<style>
.temp-sample {
	box-shadow: 0px 10px 30px rgba(122,122,122,.479);
	height: 345px;
	margin: 10px;
}
</style>

We are purposefully leaving the door open for you to create any kind of engaging app that comes to mind - just show us how easy it can be to create a beautiful UI using NativeScript.

Oh, did we mention there are significant cash prizes?! ðŸ¤‘

> Intimidated by the thought of trying to create a "beautiful" app? Have no fear! You can [request a partner](https://goo.gl/forms/3x3lDmQbm4xu0Wvn1) and we will do our best to hook up NativeScript developers with designers from Uplabs!

## Details

**[Registration](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/nativescript-uplabs-challenge) + App Submission Period:** October 14th to November 25th (6 weeks)

**Voting:** November 26th to December 5th Midnight PST (10 days)

**Winners announced:** December 6th!

> Register for the NativeScript Uplabs Challenge on [uplabs.com](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/nativescript-uplabs-challenge).

While the theme for this challenge is wide open, there are some requirements for your submission. Please, make sure that:

- Your mobile app contains at least one screen, but no more than three (keep the app somewhat simple! ðŸ˜‰).
- Your app is developed and runs in the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/) for both iOS and Android.
- Your work was created for this challenge, it's unique and your own.
- You only make one submission for this challenge.

> Please note that your app does **not** have to function with "live" data. Screens that are functional, even with mock data, works just fine for this challenge.

Remember that if you have the technical skills, but not the design skills, you can always [find a designer from Uplabs](https://goo.gl/forms/3x3lDmQbm4xu0Wvn1) to help you out!

## Inspiration

Interested in participating, but don't know where to start? You may consider a basic app that addresses a scenario such as:

- Displaying the weather and/or forecast;
- Charting/graphing some data (hint, try using [Professional NativeScript UI](https://www.nativescript.org/ui-for-nativescript) components ðŸ“Š);
- Engaging data entry forms;
- A view of hotels or housing options;
- An analytics dashboard;
- ...really anything that looks good on mobile!

Take a look at the [code samples](https://market.nativescript.org/?tab=samples&framework=all_frameworks&category=all_samples) on the NativeScript Marketplace for more ideas and starting points!

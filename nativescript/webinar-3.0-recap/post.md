# NativeScript 3.0 Webinar Recap - Faster Apps, Built with JavaScript

**A big thanks to everyone who attended last week's webinar on NativeScript 3.0!** We are always happy to see such an engaged community around NativeScript. It truly is you who have helped make this open source project into what it is today.

The entire NativeScript Developer Relations team ([Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper), [TJ VanToll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll), [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita), and [Rob Lauer](https://twitter.com/RobLauer)) put on quite a show, giving you the inside scoop on everything 3.0:

- Major performance improvements for both iOS and Android apps;
- Enhancements to our Chrome Dev Tools integration;
- Support for Angular 4 (sorry, it's "just Angular" now EMOJI);
- The just-released [Microsoft CodePush plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-code-push/);
- NativeScript CLI updates and improvements;
- [Progress NativeScript UI](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript-ui) updates;
- Sneak peak at our [roadmap](https://www.nativescript.org/roadmap) for 2017;
- ...and...DRUMROLL...the announcement of [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick)!

## Questions

Once again we leveraged Twitter to handle all of our Q&A for the event. You can actually go back in time (well, not literally) and check out all of the questions and answers by looking up the [#askNativeScript hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/askNativeScript?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=tren).

One of my favorite questions was:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I can use Angular2 in NativeScript, is it possible to use any other JS framework ? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskNativeScript?src=hash">#AskNativeScript</a></p>&mdash; Razafinirina (@tsilavina) <a href="https://twitter.com/tsilavina/status/864853578162331648">May 17, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And the answer? NativeScript was built in a manner to make it extremely flexible and not be tied to a specific framework (hence the ability to use Angular today, or not). It just so happens that we have a community-run initiative to [add Vue.js support](https://github.com/rigor789/nativescript-vue)! Look for more news on this subject in the coming weeks and months.

## What's Next?

If you're new to NativeScript, your first stop should definitely be to try one of our two end-to-end getting started tutorials:

- [Get Started with JavaScript](http://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/chapter-0)
- [Get Started with TypeScript and Angular](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0)

Also, keep an eye on the [public roadmap](https://www.nativescript.org/roadmap), as we will be continually updating it to show you what is in store for NativeScript in 2017.

**Finally, `npm install -g nativescript`, [update your apps](https://docs.nativescript.org/releases/upgrade-instructions) and enjoy the latest bits!**

# Progress NativeScript UI 2.0 is Live with Support for NativeScript 3.0

With the [big NativeScript 3.0 release](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-3.0-available-today) and all of the benefits that come with it, we are now happy to announce that the [NativeScript UI](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript-ui) suite is also upgraded to {N} 3.0.

For all of the customers of the PRO version: you can now go to your [Telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account) and download the new bits. For those of you who are using the Free version, or are simply curious to check out what the fuss is all about, here are the links to try out NativeScript UI:

# The NativeScript Community Survey is Live! üìã

As a free and open source initiative (proudly supported by [Progress](https://www.progress.com/)), NativeScript relies on its community to not only contribute to the project itself, but also to provide clear and concise feedback.

This type of feedback comes in all flavors, at all times. Maybe it's [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues), [Slack](https://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation), or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript). Otherwise it's 1:1 customer interviews or casual conversations at events and conferences.

In order to make NativeScript as successful as possible, we always look to add more and more data to guide our decisions going forward. Which is why...

**We are [launching a survey](https://progress.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJOutHRaMH4klcV) to gather feedback from you, the community that powers NativeScript!**

And of course, once the data-collection period ends, we will compile the results and report back with our findings here!

Thank you all for another great year (yeah we know there are a few months left, but hey, we are already stoked about what 2019 is going to bring for NativeScript! ‚ù§Ô∏è).

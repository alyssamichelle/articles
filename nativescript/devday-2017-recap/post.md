# NativeScript Developer Day 2017 Recap

Earlier this week, Progress hosted the second-ever [NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/). This two-day NativeScript-focused conference took place on September 18th and 19th at Scandinavia House in the heart of NYC. Space was limited, yet we had over XXX community members join us (from XXX states and XXX countries!).

## Day One

To kick things off on Monday, [Todd Anglin](https://twitter.com/toddanglin) presented a keynote chock full of announcements focused on NativeScript tooling, such as:

- The release of the NativeScript Marketplace;
- NativeScript Playground - an easy way to experiment with {N} on the web;
- Massive updates to NativeScript Sidekick;
- Not one, but TWO brand new NativeScript books!

Todd's keynote was followed by a day full of deep dive sessions in two separate tracks with plenty of options for both beginners and more seasoned {N} developers. Just a few of the highlights included:

- A ðŸ“º-side chat on plugins with Nathan Walker, Nathanael Anderson, and Brad Martin (the nStudio team);
- Jeff Whelpley and Rob Laverty provided an Angular deep dive;
- Daniel Zen held court on TypeScript and ES6 development.

At the end of day one we enjoyed some great chats (and a variety of adult beverages) on the gorgeous roof top of Scandinavia House:

There were too many other great talks to single out any individual highlights (seriously!). You can get a taste of what you missed on day two from the [NativeScript Developer Day schedule](http://developerday.nativescript.org/).

If you weren't able to attend, no worries, we did record all of the sessions and will be announcing the availability of those talks shortly.

## NativeScript ðŸ“ˆ

The NativeScript community continues to grow immensely year-over-year. As of the end of August our downloads on npm are up over XXX%! This is due to all of you, our valued community members and contributors.

Hosting an event like this was a great way for us all to continue to network, share best practices, and provide critical feedback. We couldn't be happier with the way this Developer Day turned out and we look forward to what the coming year brings us!

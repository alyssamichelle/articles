# A New Way to Learn NativeScript Layouts

When you talk about NativeScript with someone who is new to mobile app development, usually the conversation includes a sentence like:

*"You can even use your web skills like JavaScript, CSS, and XML."*

And the person looks at you like, "So...XML is a web skill?" ðŸ˜•.

Well sure it is, as much as HTML defines a presentation of UI elements, XML (in NativeScript-land) does the same for the presentation of *truly native* UI elements, ala:

	<Page>
	  <StackLayout>
	    <Label text="This is a Label!" />
		<Button text="Tap Me" />
	  </StackLayout>
	</Page>

For the most part, people grok the concept of `<TextField>` == `<input type="text">`, `<Button>` == `<input type="button">`, and such. The confusion sometimes appears when you introduce the concept of [NativeScript layout containers](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/layout-containers).

## Layout Containers?

A NativeScript layout container is effectively an HTML `<div>`, sort of. More than a `<div>` though, they describe the way in which native UI elements should be presented on the screen. For instance, the `<StackLayout orientation="vertical">` *stacks* elements on top of each other, *vertically*. Easy enough?

But layouts can get complicated, quickly. This is why learning how to construct appropriate and effective layouts is a critical part of learning to code with NativeScript.

## Learn NativeScript Layouts

Enter a new tool I affectionately call, *Learn NativeScript Layouts*. Yeah I know, it took me a while to come up with that name. ðŸ˜œ

**Available at [nslayouts.com](https://www.nslayouts.com/)**, new and experienced NativeScript developers alike can peruse a variety of exercises to learn how to use almost every type of NativeScript layout container.

Based on the same codebase that powers [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), *Learn NativeScript Layouts* eases you into learning layout containers, starting with the basic `<StackLayout>` and ending with the more complicated (and powerful) `<GridLayout>`.

Everything is open source, so you can complain to your heart's content in [the Github repo](https://github.com/rdlauer/nslayouts).

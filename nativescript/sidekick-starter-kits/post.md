# Bootstrap Your Apps with NativeScript Forge Starter Kits

Following up on last week's announcement of NativeScript Forge, this week on the blogs we are diving deep into some of the most high value features of Forge. Today is all about the starter kits - a great way to get started on your next NativeScript app.

## Types of Starter Kits

## JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular Oh My!

## What's Next for Starter Kits?

Hey Rob, 

Login and Sign Up templates will come shortly. 

We haven’t decided on what the next step should be – either work on the reference app and extract templates from it OR first work on theme customization directly from Forge – http://ux.telerik.com/wireframes/AppBuilder%20Fusion-playground/start.html#g=1&p=_____________app_settings click Edit Theme (top right), then click Add New Theme (the label is confusing). So if you start from a template, you can quickly customize how it looks. We can also integrate it with the Sass Theme Builder – http://themebuilder.telerik.com 

The more I think about it, the more I see the benefits of starting with the theme customization. I was talking with the guys from Kinvey the other day and they told me how impressed their customers are when they demo UI customization on a mobile app. They do the heavy backend work, but customers are more impressed when they show them how to change a few colors in the UI :)

Thanks,
Emo

# The Future Isn't PWA or Native - It's Both

Since the release of the first iOS and Android devices over a decade ago, we've collectively been searching for a definitive solution for efficient cross-platform app development.

We've arrived at a moment where the ubiquity of JavaScript and traditional web-based methods have now eclipsed all other forms of app development in terms of efficiency and ?. From the web (of course), to desktop, and to mobile, JavaScript is king of the platform-agnostic landscape.

> tl;dr Hybrid app development is dead. Progressive Web Apps are a great evolution of the mobile web. Native apps provide engaging experiences and full API access. Successful app developers won't pick one of the two, they will pick both. Luckily you can do both at the same time.

## Ye Olden Days of App Dev

Back in 2008, the answer appeared to be the mobile web. At the time it was effectively the *only* way to develop for the iPhone. But immature mobile browsers and weak hardware did little to boost the open web when it came to mobility.

Things changed in ??? when Steve Jobs effectively killed Flash and opened up the App Store to developers everywhere. Google quickly followed suit, and we were presented with a new opportunity to create rich apps for both major platforms.

Unfortunately for app developers, this generally meant trending away from web technologies in favor of native app development: using the languages and frameworks provided by Apple and Google to develop app that would be installed much like traditional desktop applications.

The upside was app store exposure to a growing audience. The downside was *reaching* that exposure required as massive shift in skill sets (multiplied by two!).

## PhoneGap to the Rescue...?

But there was a problem. Objective-C and Java were mostly leaving behind this amassed stable of web developers. Stuck developing mediocre experiences for underpowered browsers, web developers were ready to stake their claim on installable apps.

Enter PhoneGap. PhoneGap (known these days as its open source cousin, Apache Cordova) allows web developers to use HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript to create native-like (and natively-installable) apps for many platforms. One codebase, multiple platforms. What's not to like?

COMPROMISES IMAGE?

After a few years of hype (and an acquisition of PhoneGap's parent company by Adobe) hybrid is showing its age. In fact, aside from

As Ionic pivots away from the hybrid space, the next best thing must be...

## Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are the next evolution of the mobile web. Providing features such as offline access, service workers, and ???, PWAs are developer-friendly and more importantly provide a more engaging experience for the user.

But then why aren't PWAs the final answer? Because a web browser will never take over your device experience. Why?

- Performance
- API access
- Native feel?

What role pwas play

PWAs are one part of the puzzle. The other remains native. The good news is that for us JavaScript developers, there are prime solutions.

## NativeScript and React Native

Known in some circles as "JavaScript-native" frameworks, NativeScript and React Native stand as the two most popular ways to develop truly native cross-platform apps.

Both are free and open source. Both provide the means to use JavaScript to power native UI. Both let you use your web skills (think JavaScript + CSS) to develop you app.

NativeScript lets you use Angular, Vue.js, or VanillaJS (a.k.a. plain JavaScript). React Native lets you use React.

## Where Does that Leave Us?

We know we need to provide an experience for both iOS and Android. We know we need the reach of web AND the engagement of native.

But we don't want to write the same app all over again.

This is where NativeScript shines. By leveraging NativeScript along with Angular or Vue.js, you can share up to 80% of your PWA code with a native app.

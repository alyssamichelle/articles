# NativeScript Community Survey is Live üéâ

Today we are launching a survey to gather feedback from you, the community that powers NativeScript. Being part of an open source community means continuously soliciting feedback via a variety of sources (think along the lines of [Github issues](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues), our [community support forum](https://discourse.nativescript.org/), and [Slack](http://tinyurl.com/nativescriptslack)).

It also means taking the pulse of the community at regular intervals to make sure we are meeting both your current AND your future needs.

We know your time is valuable, so to add some incentive for filling out the survey, **we are giving away $100 gift cards** to five lucky individuals who complete the survey! üí∏üòÄ

The holidays are coming up, so wouldn't an extra $100 to Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Starbucks ‚òï be a nice gift? üòâ

*Once the data-collection period ends, we will compile the results and report back with our findings.*

Thank you for a successful 2017 and we look forward to an even more productive 2018 with NativeScript and our open source community. ‚ù§Ô∏è

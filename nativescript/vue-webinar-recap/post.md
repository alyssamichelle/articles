Last week the NativeScript Developer Relations team joined forces with [NativeScript-Vue](https://nativescript-vue.org/) creator [Igor Randjelovic](https://twitter.com/igor_randj) to provide 48 minutes of gushing love 😍 for Vue.js and the NativeScript-Vue integration.

*Included in the webinar is commentary on Vue.js, instructions on setting up your own development environment, a sneak peak on sharing code between an existing Vue.js web app and NativeScript, and a look at the NativeScript-Vue roadmap.*

## Quick Start

After the webinar, many of you are probably wondering where to go to get started. And quickly.

👉 Your best bet for a super easy startup experience is the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-vue). The NativeScript Playground is where you can play around with NativeScript and Vue.js in your browser. Use the Playground to drag-and-drop components, write code, and preview your app on a physical device.

👉 If you're interested in diving deeper, you need to [install NativeScript tools locally](https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/getting-started/installation) and then [pick a Vue-based template](https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/getting-started/templates) to start developing app.

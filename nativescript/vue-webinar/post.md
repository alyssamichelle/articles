# A New Vue for NativeScript - Webinar Edition

Almost exactly one year ago, [Igor Randjelovic](https://twitter.com/igor_randj) made a now-famous tweet regarding the potential of Vue.js and NativeScript:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Managed to use a <a href="https://twitter.com/vuejs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vuejs</a> instance to control a <a href="https://twitter.com/NativeScript?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NativeScript</a> native label!

Fast forward to today. The [NativeScript-Vue](https://nativescript-vue.org/) integration has turned 1.0 and we are here to celebrate this new relationship with its own webinar! ðŸŽ‰

## Why Vue.js?

Favored by developers who aren't so crazy about the Angular or React approaches to JavaScript development, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) has proven itself as THE alternative to the two mainstays. *Why?* Likely for one of a few reasons:

- Vue feels familiar to those used to working with AngularJS;
- Vue doesn't require a switch to TypeScript;
- Vue is (arguably) easier to get started with than Angular or React.

> "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight without all the extra concepts involved?" - Vue.js creator, Evan You.

Vue is a *progressive JavaScript framework* and can be adopted incrementally, over time. You don't have to sell out your entire app to Vue, but rather use the bits and pieces that make you a more productive developer. It's a great first-framework for developers moving forward from the jQuery age.

In the case of NativeScript, it's ridiculously easy to translate your web-based Vue knowledge to native mobile:

	const Vue = require("nativescript-vue");
	
	new Vue({
	  methods: {
	    onButtonTap() {
	      console.log("Button was pressed");
	    },
	  },
	
	  template: `
	    <Page class="page">
	      <ActionBar title="Home" class="action-bar" />
	      <StackLayout>
	        <Image src="https://play.nativescript.org/dist/assets/img/NativeScript_logo.png" />
	        <Button text="Button" @tap="onButtonTap" />
	       </StackLayout>
	    </Page>
	  `,
	
	}).$start();

Yep, the code above powers a **truly native mobile app** running on both iOS and Android. Looks awfully similar to your Vue-based web app, no? ðŸ˜€

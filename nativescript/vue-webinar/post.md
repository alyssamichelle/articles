# A New Vue for NativeScript - Webinar Edition

About a year(?) ago, one of our prominent community members, Igor ???, made a note on one of the NativeScript slack channels:

Favored by some Angular and React developers who aren't as comfortable with those framework's "heavy handed" approach to JavaScript development, Vue has proven itself as THE alternative to the two mainstays.

Fast forward to today. The most popular NativeScript plugin, nativescript-vue, has turned 1.0 and we are here to celebrate Vue with its own webinar.

Join us on Thursday, March 28th at 11AM ET as we dive into:

- How Vue can improve your NativeScript development experience;
- What is coming from the Vue community;
- Something else...

Even better, the NativeScript Developer Relations team will be joined by nativescript-vue creator, and, ???.

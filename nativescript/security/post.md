# Securing a NativeScript App

It almost goes without saying that security is paramount with virtually any software development project these days. We are all guilty of taking short cuts in the past (I remember storing clear text passwords myself back in the day) but thankfully we have numerous options to help us 

NativeScript, React Native, and Cordova-based hybrid apps all get a bad rap for storing application assets in an unencrypted/uncompiled state on the device. Unfortunately it's just as easy to decompile an iOS or Android app created with Swift/Objective-C/Java and access the application code.

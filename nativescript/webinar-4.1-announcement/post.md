# Angular and Vue.js Web to Mobile Code Sharing Webinar

The next major version of NativeScript is here! üéâ

With the [4.0 release](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-4.0-is-out) we've seen a host of significant features and improvements. And [NativeScript 4.1 just came out last week](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/announcing-the-nativescript-4.1-release), providing even *more* enhancements such as:

- **50% faster launch times** on Android (for real üòÄ)
- Full support for **Angular 6**
- **Augmented Reality** support, CSS gradients, and improved tooling

Since the next major version of NativeScript is here, it's time to take a closer look üßê at the latest and greatest.

# The NEXT NativeScript Conference

Last September in New York City, we held the second-ever [NativeScript Developer Day](http://developerday.nativescript.org/). A fantastic array of speakers and attendees combined to provide an opportune environment for learning more our about beloved open source framework.

Well there is an *even larger* conference at the end of May with **massive mobility-focused tracks** that include loads of NativeScript content!

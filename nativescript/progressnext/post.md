# The NEXT NativeScript Conference

Last September in New York City, we held the second-ever NativeScript Developer Day. A fantastic array of speakers and attendees combined to provide an opportune environment for learning more our about beloved framework.

Did you know there is an even larger conference coming up in May with a **massive** mobility track that includes loads of NativeScript content?

ProgressNEXT is quite literally a global gathering of developers and IT professionals that covers the entire Progress portfolio.

> Did you know that Progress sponsors the open source work behind NativeScript? Now you know!

Hosted at the beautiful ??? in Boston, from May 29th to June 1st, ProgressNEXT is this spring's source for IT knowledge sharing.
